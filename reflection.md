What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I haven't used Python before so I was relying on the suggestions and looking things up quite a bit which was a pain. I used ChatGPT to help with formattting syntax and debugging. On the good side, object oriented programming in general felt familiar from AP Computer Science A which I had two years ago so I pretty much knew what I was trying to write the whole time. The video was very helpful to get started (especially since setting up VSCode wasn't super intuitive) so I would tell future students they should probably watch those.
